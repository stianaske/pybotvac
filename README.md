# pybotvac

This is an unofficial API for controlling Neato Botvac Connected vacuum robots.

## Disclaimer
This API is experimental. Use at your own risk. Feel free to contribute if things are not working.

## Installation
Install using pip

```bash
pip install pybotvac
```

Alternatively, clone the repository and run

```bash
python setup.py install
```

## Usage
### Robot
If the serial and secret for your robot is known, simply run

```python
>>> from pybotvac import Robot
>>> robot = Robot('OPS01234-0123456789AB', '0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF', 'my_robot_name')
>>> print(robot)
Name: sample_robot, Serial: OPS01234-0123456789AB, Secret: 0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF
```

The format of the serial should be 'OPSxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx', and the secret should be a string of hex characters 32 characters long.
These can be found by using the Account class.

To start cleaning

```python
robot.start_cleaning()
```

If no exception occurred, your robot should now get to work.

Currently the following methods are available in the Robot class:

* get_robot_state()
* start_cleaning()
* start_spot_cleaning()
* pause_cleaning()
* stop_cleaning()
* send_to_base()
* enable_schedule()
* disable_schedule()
* get_schedule()

For convenience, properties exist for state and schedule

```python
# Get state
state = robot.state

# Check if schedule is enabled
robot.schedule_enabled

# Disable schedule
robot.schedule_enabled = False
```

### Account
If the serial and secret is unknown, they can be retrieved using the Account class.

```python
>>> from pybotvac import Account
>>> # List all robots associated with account
>>> for robot in Account('sample@email.com', 'sample_password').robots:
...     print(robot)
Name: my_robot_name, Serial: OPS01234-0123456789AB, Secret: 0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF, Traits: ['maps']
```

Information about maps and download of maps can be done from the Account class:

```python
>>> from pybotvac import Account
>>> # List all maps associated with a specific robot
>>> for map_info in Account('sample@email.com', 'sample_password').maps:
...     print(map_info)
```

A cleaning map can be downloaded with the account class. Returns the raw image response. Example shows latest map.
You need the url from the map output to do that:

```python
>>> from pybotvac import Account
>>> # List all maps associated with a specific robot
>>> map = Account('sample@email.com', 'sample_password').maps
>>> download_link = map['robot_serial']['maps'][0]['url']
>>> Account('sample@email.com', 'sample_password').get_map_image(download_link)
```
